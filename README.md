# A cleaning robot implemented with AI
The behavior of the robot was implemented by a Finite State Machine (FSM) and a Behavior Tree (BT)

## Finite State Machine
The Finite State Machine used in this project is show below:

## Behavior Tree
The same behavior can be reached by the following Behavior Tree:
